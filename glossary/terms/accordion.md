# Accordion

>User interface components in web design that allow content to expand or collapse upon user interaction, providing space-efficient content organization and enhancing user experience.

## Definition

Accordions, in web design, are user interface components that allow content to be shown or hidden when a user interacts with them. They are often used to save screen space and present information in a structured and space-efficient manner. Accordions typically consist of a series of headers or tabs, and when a user clicks or taps on a header, the associated content expands or collapses, revealing or hiding additional information.

## Real Life Example

On a FAQ page of a website, you might find an accordion where each question serves as a header, and clicking on a question expands to reveal the answer.

## Why Itâ€™s Important

1. Space Efficiency: Accordions are valuable for presenting large amounts of content in a compact format, reducing clutter.
2. User-Friendly: They enhance the user experience by allowing users to access information selectively.
3. Organization: Accordions help structure content and make it more accessible.
4. Mobile Optimization: They are particularly useful for mobile devices with limited screen space.
5. Engagement: Accordions encourage user interaction and exploration of content.

## Commonly Confused For

Accordions are sometimes confused with tabs, but they function slightly differently. Tabs typically switch between different sections of content, while accordions expand or collapse content within the same section.
