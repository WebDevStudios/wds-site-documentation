# Alt Text
>Descriptive text for images to enhance accessibility.

## Definition

Alt Text, short for "alternative text," is a descriptive text attribute added to an image element in HTML code. It serves as a text-based alternative for users who cannot see images, providing context and accessibility by describing the content and purpose of the image.

## Real Life Example

In a blog post, an image of a mountain landscape might have alt text that reads, "Scenic mountain landscape with snow-capped peaks and clear blue sky.”

## Why It’s Important

1. [Accessibility](https://www.notion.so/Accessibility-4097a93f82384bb2b2acceabfb58d7bd?pvs=21): Alt text ensures that users with visual impairments using screen readers can understand the image's content and context.
2. [SEO](https://www.notion.so/SEO-Search-Engine-Optimization-bfaba8fa435944b88b2ed82748eba960?pvs=21) Benefits: Search engines use alt text to understand and index images, potentially improving a website's search engine visibility.
3. Contextual Information: Alt text provides valuable information about images, enhancing the overall comprehension and user experience of the content.
4. Legal Compliance: Many countries require websites to provide accessible content, including images with proper alt text, to comply with accessibility laws.
5. Image Failure Handling: When images fail to load due to slow connections or other issues, alt text offers a fallback description to convey the image's purpose.

## Commonly Confused For

Alt text is sometimes confused with captions. While alt text provides a concise description of an image's content, captions provide additional context or explanations, often appearing directly below the image.
