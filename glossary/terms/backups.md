# Backups

>Data safety copies.

## Definition

Backups are copies of your website's files and data that are created and stored separately from your primary website. They serve as a safety net in case of data loss, security breaches, or website malfunctions.

## Real Life Example

Let's say you have a website for your online store. Regular backups would involve creating duplicate copies of your website's files, including web pages, images, databases, and other important data. These copies are securely stored in a separate location, such as a cloud storage service or an external hard drive.

## Why You Might Need/Use It

1. Disaster Recovery: Backups ensure that you have a copy of your website's data to restore in case of unexpected events like server crashes, hacking attempts, or accidental deletion.
2. Data Loss Prevention: If your website experiences data corruption or accidental data loss, having backups allows you to retrieve and restore your website's content and functionality.
3. Website Updates and Changes: Before making significant changes to your website, such as updating plugins, themes, or making structural modifications, creating a backup is crucial. This allows you to roll back to a previous working version if anything goes wrong during the update process.
4. Content Protection: Backups can protect your valuable website content, including blog posts, customer data, and media files, ensuring that they can be recovered even if they get compromised or lost.
5. Website Migration: If you plan to move your website to a new hosting provider or change platforms, backups provide a means to transfer your website's files and data to the new environment smoothly.

## Commonly Confused For

1. Archives: Backups are often confused with archives. While backups focus on creating copies of current website data for disaster recovery, archives are long-term storage of historical data that may or may not be actively used.
2. Version Control: Version control systems, like Git, track changes to code and facilitate collaboration among developers. Although backups may include code files, version control is more geared towards code management and tracking revisions rather than complete website backups.
3. Redundancy: Redundancy refers to having duplicate hardware or systems in place to ensure continuous operation in case of failures. While backups can be part of a redundancy strategy, redundancy is a broader concept encompassing various redundancy mechanisms.
