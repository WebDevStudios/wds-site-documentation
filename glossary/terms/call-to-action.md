# Call to Action

>Prompt that drives user actions for desired outcomes.

## Definition

A Call to Action (CTA) refers to a prompt or directive that encourages users to take a specific action, such as clicking a button, signing up, making a purchase, or subscribing to a newsletter. CTAs are strategically placed in designs to guide users toward a desired conversion or engagement.

## Real Life Example

A CTA button with the text "Get Started" on a landing page encourages users to click and begin the sign-up process for a service.

## Why Itâ€™s Important

1. Conversion Focus: CTAs direct user attention toward desired actions, helping convert visitors into customers, subscribers, or engaged users.
2. Clear Communication: Well-crafted CTAs use concise and actionable language, leaving no ambiguity about the desired action and its benefits.
3. User Guidance: CTAs guide users through a website or application by suggesting the next steps and facilitating seamless navigation.
4. Goal Achievement: CTAs align with specific business goals, such as increasing sales, building email lists, or driving engagement, and track measurable outcomes.
5. Testing and Optimization: By testing different CTAs, placement, and design, designers can optimize their effectiveness and improve conversion rates over time.

## Commonly Confused For

CTAs are sometimes confused with links. While both encourage actions, CTAs are designed to stand out visually and use persuasive language to motivate users to take specific actions.
