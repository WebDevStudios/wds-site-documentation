# Deployment

>Process of making a website or application live for user access.

## Definition

Deployment in web development refers to the process of moving a website or application from a development or staging environment to a live production environment, making it accessible to users. It involves tasks like configuring servers, uploading files, and ensuring proper functionality in the live environment.

## Real Life Example

After development and testing, a web application is deployed to a production server, allowing users to access and interact with it.

## Why Itâ€™s Important

1. User Accessibility: Deployment makes the website or application available to users for actual use.
2. Testing and Validation: Proper deployment involves testing the application in the live environment to ensure it functions as expected.
3. Updates and Changes: Regular deployment facilitates the implementation of new features, fixes, and improvements.
4. Rollback Planning: Deployments should be planned to allow for easy rollback in case of unforeseen issues.
5. Performance Optimization: Deployment involves configuring servers and resources to ensure optimal performance for users.

## Commonly Confused For

Deployment is sometimes confused with development. While development involves creating and coding the application, deployment is the process of making the application live for users.
