# Development Site

>Work-in-progress website.

## Definition

A development site, also known as a staging site or a test environment, refers to a separate version of a website that is used for building, testing, and refining before it is deployed to the production site. It is a controlled environment where developers, designers, and content creators can work on website changes or new features without affecting the live production site.

## Real Life Example

Imagine you want to make significant updates to your existing website, such as redesigning the layout, adding new functionalities, or testing different plugins. Instead of making these changes directly on the live production site, you set up a development site. On the development site, you can experiment, make modifications, and test the changes thoroughly before deploying them to the live site.

## Why You Might Need/Use It

1. Safe Testing Ground: A development site provides a safe environment to test new features, design changes, or code updates without impacting the live production site. It allows you to experiment, troubleshoot, and identify any issues or conflicts before making those changes visible to your website visitors.
2. Collaboration and Iteration: Development sites facilitate collaboration among team members working on different aspects of the website. Designers, developers, and content creators can simultaneously work on the development site, reviewing and refining the changes. It allows for iteration, feedback, and improvements before finalizing the updates for the production site.
3. Quality Assurance: By having a development site, you can thoroughly test the website's functionality, compatibility, and performance across different devices and browsers. It helps in identifying and fixing any bugs, errors, or issues before those changes go live. Quality assurance ensures a smooth user experience on the production site.
4. Content Creation and Review: Development sites enable content creators to draft, review, and refine website content without making it immediately visible to the public. It provides an opportunity for content collaboration, editing, and approval processes before the content is published on the live site.
5. Version Control and Backup: Having a development site allows you to maintain a version-controlled environment. It means you can track and manage changes made to the website over time. Additionally, development sites serve as a backup for the live production site, providing an extra layer of protection against data loss or accidental changes.

## Commonly Confused For

1. Production Site: Development sites are often mistaken for the production site, especially when they are visually similar or have similar content. However, the key difference is that development sites are not publicly accessible and are intended for testing and development purposes only.
2. Staging Site: Development sites and staging sites are similar in concept and purpose. They both provide a controlled environment for testing and refining changes before deployment to the live site. The distinction may vary depending on individual workflows or terminology preferences.
3. Local Development Environment: A local development environment refers to running the website on a local computer or a local server. It allows developers to work on the site without an internet connection. While similar in purpose, a development site typically resides on a server accessible to the development team.
