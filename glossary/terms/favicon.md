1. Brand Identity: Favicon reinforces brand identity by displaying a visual representation of the brand's logo or symbol across various browser tabs and bookmarks.
2. Visual Recognition: Favicon helps users quickly recognize and locate a specific website among multiple open tabs and bookmarks.
3. Professionalism: Having a favicon adds a level of professionalism to a website, indicating attention to detail and a consistent brand presence.
4. Improved User Experience: Favicon contributes to a better user experience by making navigation more efficient and visually appealing.
5. Browser Compatibility: Favicon ensures a consistent visual experience across different web browsers, contributing to a seamless user experience.
