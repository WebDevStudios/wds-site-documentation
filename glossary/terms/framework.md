# Framework

>Pre-built structure for efficient development of WordPress themes or plugins.

## Definition

A Framework refers to a pre-built structure that provides a foundation for developing themes or plugins. It includes standardized code, libraries, and conventions that streamline development, enhance security, and ensure compatibility with WordPress core functionalities.

## Real Life Example

A WordPress framework might provide predefined template files, functions for common tasks, and consistent coding practices.

## Why Itâ€™s Important

1. Rapid Development: Frameworks accelerate development by offering pre-built components and coding patterns.
2. Consistency: Frameworks enforce coding standards, leading to consistent and maintainable code.
3. Security: Reputable frameworks adhere to best security practices, reducing vulnerabilities in themes or plugins.
4. Compatibility: Frameworks ensure that themes or plugins work seamlessly with the latest WordPress updates.
5. Customization: Developers can build on a framework's foundation, adding tailored features while saving development time.

## Commonly Confused For

Frameworks in WordPress might be confused with parent themes. While both provide a foundation for development, frameworks are more comprehensive, including predefined functionalities beyond basic styling.
