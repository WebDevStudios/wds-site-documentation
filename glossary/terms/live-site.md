# Live Site

>Published website.

## Definition

In the context of a website or online platform, "live" refers to the state of being accessible and active on the internet. When a website is live, it means it is fully functional and available for users to visit, interact with, and view its content in real-time.

## Real Life Example

Imagine you have been working on designing and developing your website. After completing all the necessary steps, such as creating pages, adding content, configuring settings, and testing functionality, you are ready to make your website live. This means you will publish it and make it accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Once your website is live, visitors can access it by typing the URL in a web browser and explore its features and content.

## Commonly Confused For

1. Development or Staging Environment: Live websites are often confused with development or staging environments. Development environments are used for building and testing websites or features before making them live. Staging environments are a step closer to being live and are used for final testing and review before deployment. Once a website is live, it means it is accessible to the public.
2. Under Construction or Maintenance Pages: While a website is under construction or undergoing maintenance, it may display temporary pages informing visitors that the site is not yet live or experiencing updates. These pages typically include messages like "Coming Soon" or "Under Maintenance." They are placeholders until the site is fully live and operational.
3. Preview or Localhost: Previewing a website or running it on a local server (localhost) allows you to view and test it on your local machine without it being publicly accessible. These environments are not live as they are limited to individual devices or local networks.
