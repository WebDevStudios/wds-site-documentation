# Migration

>Process of transferring data or applications between environments or platforms.

## Definition

Migration, in the context of web development, refers to the process of transferring data, applications, or websites from one environment or platform to another. This could involve moving data from an old server to a new one, upgrading software versions, or changing hosting providers.

## Real Life Example

A website migration might involve moving content, databases, and settings from a local development environment to a live server for public access.

## Why Itâ€™s Important

1. Upgrades and Enhancements: Migration allows for the adoption of newer technologies, software versions, or infrastructure improvements.
2. Risk Management: Proper planning and execution of migrations help minimize data loss and downtime during transitions.
3. Server Changes: Moving websites or applications to more powerful servers can improve performance and accommodate increased traffic.
4. Platform Shifts: Migrating from one content management system (CMS) to another or switching e-commerce platforms can offer new features and better capabilities.
5. Data Consistency: Migrations ensure that data remains consistent and intact while transitioning to a new environment.

## Commonly Confused For

Migration can sometimes be confused with cloning or copying. While migration involves moving data to a new environment, cloning is about creating a duplicate for testing or backup purposes.
