# Mockup

>Visual design preview.

## Definition

A mockup is a visual representation or draft of a webpage, application, or design project that showcases the intended final look and feel. It serves as a more detailed version of a wireframe, incorporating colors, typography, images, and other visual elements to provide a realistic preview of the final product. Mockups aim to capture the overall visual aesthetic and user interface of a design concept.

## Real Life Example

Let's say you're working with a web design agency to create a new website for your company. The agency presents you with a mockup that illustrates the homepage design. This mockup displays the actual colors, typography, logo, and images that will be used in the final website. It provides a clear visual representation of how the various elements will be arranged on the page.

## Why Itâ€™s Important

1. Visual Representation: Mockups allow you to see and evaluate the overall visual representation of your website or design project. They provide a realistic preview of how the final product will look, enabling you to assess the aesthetics and branding elements.
2. Design Consistency: Mockups ensure design consistency across various pages and sections of a website. By presenting a unified visual style, they help maintain a cohesive user experience and reinforce your brand identity.
3. Client Approval: Mockups are essential for client collaboration and approval. They provide a tangible design concept that clients can review, provide feedback on, and request revisions before moving forward with the development stage.
4. Alignment with Branding: Mockups allow you to assess how the design aligns with your brand guidelines, including the use of colors, typography, imagery, and overall style. They help ensure that the design accurately represents your brand's personality and resonates with your target audience.

## Commonly Confused For

Mockups are sometimes confused with wireframes or prototypes. While wireframes focus on the layout and structure, mockups add visual elements and represent the final visual design. Prototypes, on the other hand, are interactive representations that simulate user interactions and functionalities of a website or application.
