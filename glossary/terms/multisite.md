# Multisite

>Feature allowing management of multiple sites from a single WordPress installation.

## Definition

WordPress Multisite is a feature within WordPress that enables users to create and manage multiple independent websites from a single WordPress installation. It allows administrators to run a network of sites with shared resources while giving each site its own content, themes, and plugins. WordPress Multisite is particularly useful for organizations, institutions, or individuals managing several websites.

## Real Life Example

A university can use WordPress Multisite to maintain separate websites for different departments while sharing the same user authentication.

## Why Itâ€™s Important

1. Centralized Management: WordPress Multisite streamlines the management of multiple websites from a single dashboard.
2. Resource Efficiency: Shared themes, plugins, and user management save resources compared to maintaining separate installations.
3. Consistent Branding: Multisite allows consistent branding across different sites while maintaining unique content.
4. Simplified Updates: Updates can be applied to all sites from one installation, ensuring security and compatibility.
5. Scalability: WordPress Multisite is scalable, accommodating the addition of new sites as needed.

## Commonly Confused For

WordPress Multisite is distinct from managing multiple standalone websites. While Multisite operates within a single installation, standalone websites involve separate WordPress installations, each requiring individual maintenance and resources.
