# PNG (Portable Network Graphics)

>Lossless image compression.

## Definition

PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is a popular file format used for storing and displaying images on websites and digital platforms. It is a lossless image format that supports high-quality graphics while maintaining a relatively small file size. PNG files are widely supported across different browsers and operating systems, making them a suitable choice for web-based graphics.

## Real Life Example

Suppose you want to add a logo or an illustration to your website. To ensure the image quality is preserved while keeping the file size manageable, you save it as a PNG file. The PNG format allows for crisp and clear graphics with transparent backgrounds, making it suitable for logos, icons, and graphics that require fine details.

## Why You Might Need/Use It

1. Transparent Backgrounds: PNG supports transparency, allowing you to create images with transparent backgrounds. This is particularly useful when you want to overlay an image onto different backgrounds or blend it seamlessly with the content on your website.
2. High-Quality Graphics: PNG is a lossless format, meaning it retains all the details and quality of the original image. It supports a wide range of colors and can display complex graphics, making it suitable for images that require high fidelity and sharpness.
3. Web Compatibility: PNG files are widely supported across different web browsers, making them accessible to a broad audience. They are compatible with major operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring your images can be viewed correctly by website visitors using various devices.
4. Image Editing: PNG files support transparency and multiple layers, making them suitable for image editing and manipulation. You can use image editing software to modify or enhance PNG images without losing quality. This flexibility allows you to customize graphics to suit your website's design and requirements.
5. Lossless Compression: PNG uses lossless compression techniques, which means the image quality remains intact even after compression. This ensures that the details, colors, and transparency of the image are preserved while minimizing the file size. It strikes a balance between image quality and file size optimization.

## Commonly Confused For

1. JPEG: PNG is often confused with JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), which is another popular image format. The key difference is that JPEG is a lossy format, meaning it sacrifices some image quality to achieve smaller file sizes. JPEG is more suitable for photographs or complex images with many colors, while PNG is ideal for graphics with sharp edges, transparency, or text.
2. GIF: GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is another image format that supports transparency and animations. While GIF can be used for similar purposes as PNG, it has limitations in terms of color support and image quality. PNG is preferred for high-quality static images, while GIF is more commonly used for simple animations or graphics with limited color palettes.
3. SVG: SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a vector-based image format that uses XML markup to define shapes, lines, and colors. While both SVG and PNG can be used for web graphics, SVG is primarily used for scalable graphics that can be resized without loss of quality. PNG, on the other hand, is suitable for static images with fixed dimensions.
