# Production Site

>Live operational website.

## Definition

A production site, also known as a live site or a live production environment, refers to the operational version of a website or online platform that is accessible to the public and actively serving its intended audience. It is the fully functional and publicly available version of a website that represents the final product or service.

## Real Life Example

Suppose you have been working on developing a website for your business. After completing the design, development, and testing phases, you are ready to deploy it to the production site. Once deployed, the production site becomes the official online representation of your business, allowing customers to access your products, services, and content.

## Commonly Confused For

1. Development or Staging Environment: A production site is often confused with development or staging environments. Development environments are used for building, testing, and refining the website before it is deployed to the production site. Staging environments are a step closer to the production site, serving as a final testing ground before the website goes live.
2. Pre-Launch or Under Construction Pages: Before a production site is launched, it might display pre-launch or under construction pages. These pages indicate that the site is still in progress and will be available soon. They act as placeholders until the actual production site is ready to serve its intended purpose.
3. Localhost or Offline Versions: Localhost or offline versions of a website are only accessible on specific devices or local servers. They are not publicly accessible and do not represent the true production site. Localhost or offline versions are typically used for development, testing, or local demonstrations.
