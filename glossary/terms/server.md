# Server

>Computer or software system that stores and delivers data and applications over networks.

## Definition

A Server, in the context of web development, is a powerful computer or software system that stores and manages data, content, or applications and serves them to clients over a network, such as the internet. Servers handle requests and responses, facilitating communication between clients (user devices) and various web services.

## Real Life Example

A web server stores website files and serves them to users' browsers when they access the site.

## Why Itâ€™s Important

1. Data Storage: Servers store databases, files, and content required for websites and applications.
2. Data Processing: Servers process requests, retrieve data, and perform computations before sending responses to clients.
3. Scalability: Servers can be scaled up to handle increased traffic and demand from users.
4. Accessibility: Servers make web content available to users anytime and anywhere, ensuring global accessibility.
5. Application Deployment: Servers host applications, making them accessible to users via the internet.

## Commonly Confused For

Servers are sometimes confused with clients. While servers store and deliver data, clients are devices (such as computers, smartphones) that access and request data from servers.
