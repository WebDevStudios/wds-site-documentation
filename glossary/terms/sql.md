# Structured Query Language (SQL)

>Language for managing and querying relational databases.

## Definition

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a standardized way to interact with databases, enabling users to perform tasks such as querying data, inserting, updating, and deleting records, as well as defining database structure.

## Real Life Example

Using SQL, a query could retrieve all products from a database with prices greater than $50.

## Why Itâ€™s Important

1. Data Retrieval: SQL enables precise extraction of specific data from databases using queries.
2. Data Manipulation: SQL allows adding, updating, and deleting records, maintaining accurate and current data.
3. Database Design: SQL is used to define database structure, tables, relationships, and constraints.
4. Reporting and Analysis: SQL queries help generate customized reports and perform data analysis.
5. Data Integrity: Properly designed SQL queries ensure data consistency and accuracy.

## Commonly Confused For

SQL is sometimes confused with a database. While SQL is a language used to interact with databases, a database is an organized collection of structured data.
