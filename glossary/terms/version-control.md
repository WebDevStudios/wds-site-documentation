# Version Control

>System for tracking and managing changes to code and files.

## Definition

Version Control, also known as source code management or revision control, is a system that tracks changes to files and code over time. It allows developers to collaborate, manage different versions of code, and maintain a history of modifications, enabling efficient code management and teamwork.

## Real Life Example

Using version control, developers can work on separate branches of code, merge changes, and maintain a history of who made modifications and when.

## Why Itâ€™s Important

1. Collaboration: Version control enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts.
2. History Tracking: It maintains a detailed history of changes, facilitating debugging, troubleshooting, and identifying issues.
3. Rollbacks and Revisions: Version control allows easy rollback to previous versions in case of bugs or errors.
4. Branching Strategies: Developers can create separate branches for different features or fixes, improving organization and development workflow.
5. Backup and Recovery: Version control serves as a backup, ensuring code is not lost due to hardware failures or mistakes.

## Commonly Confused For

Version control is sometimes confused with file sharing tools. While both involve collaboration, version control specifically focuses on tracking code changes and managing revisions.
