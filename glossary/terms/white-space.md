2. Readability: Adequate white space enhances readability by preventing overcrowding and allowing text and images to breathe, making content easier to absorb.
3. Aesthetics: Thoughtful use of white space contributes to the overall aesthetic appeal of a design, conveying a sense of elegance and sophistication.
4. Balance and Organization: White space helps create a balanced and organized layout, ensuring that elements are well-proportioned and harmonious.
5. User Experience: White space improves the user experience by reducing cognitive load and preventing information overload, leading to a more enjoyable interaction.
