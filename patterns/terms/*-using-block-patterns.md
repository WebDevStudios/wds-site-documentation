Here's an overview of how to use your Block Patterns:

Block patterns are pre-designed layouts that can easily be added to your WordPress site to create beautiful, professional-looking pages and posts. This guide will walk you through inserting block patterns onto your site and customizing them with your content.

Explore Block Patterns
----------------------

To browse and add block patterns to your content, follow these steps:

1.  **Access the Block Inserter:**

    -   Log in to your WordPress dashboard.

    -   Navigate to Pages or Posts and select the page or post you want to edit.

2.  **Add Block Patterns:**

    -   In the editing screen, click the + Block Inserter icon in the top left corner.

    -   Click on the Patterns tab.

    -   Browse categories like Text, Gallery, Header, Forms, and more.

        -   Click on the "Explore all patterns" button for an expanded view.

    -   Click on any pattern to add it to your page at the cursor location.

Using Block Patterns
--------------------

Once inserted, you can customize block patterns to suit your needs:

1.  **Content Editing:**

    -   Click on any block to edit its content.

    -   Replace existing text or images as needed.

    -   Utilize Document Overview to manage blocks within the pattern.

2.  **Images in Block Patterns:**

    -   The images included in block patterns are carefully selected to complement your site's design. While they are provided for convenience, you can replace them with new content if desired. Additionally, if you wish to use a pattern on another page or post and prefer different visuals, feel free to substitute them with alternative images or creative elements that better suit your needs.

Troubleshooting
---------------

-   Some components within the patterns have essential classes that must remain intact to preserve the design integrity. Removing these classes may result in layout issues.

-   If a component loses its class, refer to the components' outline in each pattern's documentation to identify the correct class. Alternatively, removing and re-adding the pattern can reset it to the default state with the necessary classes.

Following these steps, you can efficiently leverage block patterns to enhance the design and functionality of your WordPress site's pages and posts.
