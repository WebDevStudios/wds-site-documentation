Description
-----------

The 50/50 Pattern: One offers a full-width WordPress Pattern, providing editors with a balanced layout to showcase content effectively. Editors can seamlessly adjust the default blocks or incorporate additional core blocks to tailor the pattern to their specific needs. The 50/50 Pattern: One is versatile and can be implemented on any Page or Post, enhancing content presentation and engagement.

Pattern Components
------------------

The 50/50 Pattern: One Pattern comprises the following Core Blocks within a Group Block:

-   **Group (class: "pattern-one"):** This serves as the primary container for pattern one, providing structural organization and styling.

    -   **Media & Text:** This block serves as the foundational element of the 50/50 Pattern: One, enabling editors to combine media (image) with accompanying text content seamlessly.

        -   **Image:** Within the Media & Text block, editors can insert an image to complement the textual content. The image setting is integral to the Media & Text block and not a separate entity.

        -   **Heading (h3):** Provides a sub-heading element to introduce or emphasize key points related to the content.

        -   **Heading (h2):** Offers a primary heading element, allowing editors to highlight the main topic or subject matter of the content.

        -   **Paragraph:** Allows editors to input descriptive text, providing additional context or details related to the content.

        -   **Button:** Enables editors to incorporate call-to-action buttons within the content, directing users to relevant links or actions.

        -   **Group (class: shadow):** Facilitates the organization of blocks within a nested structure, enhancing content management and customization.

            -   **Columns:** The Columns block divides the content area into two equal parts, accommodating separate content elements side by side.

                -   **Column 1:** Within the Columns block, Column 1 hosts an image block, allowing editors to include visual elements aligned with the content.

                -   **Column 2:** Accommodates textual elements, including a sub-heading (Heading h4) and a paragraph, providing additional information or context related to the content.
